```java
@CrossOrigin("http://localhost:5173")
```

---

## üñº UI

- Responsive design  
- Clean layout using cards and tables

---

## üõ† To Run the Project

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the frontend dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

> Make sure the Spring Boot backend is running on `localhost:8080`.

## üìå Future Improvements

- Add `Edit` functionality  
- Validate form inputs  
- Show loading spinners and success/error toasts  
- Add pagination for long lists
